		Title:  "hjkl — Move Without Arrow Keys",
		Summary: "Vim keeps your fingers on the home row: h moves left, l moves right, " +
			"j moves down (think: j looks like a hook dropping down), k moves up. " +
			"No mouse, no arrow keys — just h j k l.",
		Challenges: []Challenge{
			{
				Title: "First Steps",
				Instructions: "h moves the cursor one cell left, l moves it one cell right, " +
					"j moves it one cell down, k moves it one cell up. There's no diagonal " +
					"key — to move diagonally you just press two of them, like j then l. " +
					"Reach the G using only h j k l.",
				Tip: "Tip: h j k l sit right under your fingers on the home row (no need to move " +
					"your hand to an arrow-key cluster) — that's the whole reason Vim uses them.",

			{
				Title: "Bigger Maze",
				Instructions: "Same four keys, longer trip: chain together presses of h j k l — " +
					"in any order — to cross the whole grid and land exactly on the G.",
				Tip: "Tip: you can prefix a motion with a number to repeat it, e.g. 5j moves down " +
					"5 cells in a single keystroke instead of pressing j five times — try it here.",

		Week:   "Week 1: Basic Movement",
		Title:  "Word Motions — w, e, b",
		Summary: "Moving one letter at a time is slow. w jumps to the start of the next word, " +
			"e jumps to the end of the current/next word, b jumps back to the start of the " +
			"previous word. This is how fast Vim users cross a line in a few keystrokes.",
		Challenges: []Challenge{
			{
				Title: "Jump Forward",
				Instructions: "w moves the cursor to the very first character of the next word — " +
					"punctuation and symbols like $ count as words of their own. Press w " +
					"repeatedly to land exactly on the $ below.",
				Tip: "Tip: try it mentally on \"one two three\" — from \"one\", a single w lands " +

			{
				Title: "Jump Backward",
				Instructions: "b moves the cursor back to the start of a word. If the cursor " +
					"isn't already sitting on a word's first letter, the first b snaps back to " +
					"the start of the word you're currently inside — not the previous word. " +
					"Starting at the end of the line, use b to walk backward onto the $.",
				Tip: "Tip: this trips a lot of people up — from the middle of \"high\", the first " +
					"b lands on the \"h\" of \"high\" itself, and only the next b moves further back.",

			{
				Title: "Land On the Last Letter",
				Instructions: "e moves the cursor to the END of the current or next word, instead " +
					"of the start like w does. Use e to land precisely on the last letter of " +
					"\"target\", the third word below.",
				Tip: "Tip: w vs e is the key distinction to remember — w lands on a word's " +
					"first letter, e lands on its last. Whichever is closer costs fewer presses.",

		Week:   "Week 1: Basic Movement & Modes",
		Title:  "Insert Mode — i, A, o",
		Summary: "Normal mode is for moving and editing; Insert mode is for typing. " +
			"i enters Insert mode before the cursor, A jumps to end-of-line and enters " +
			"Insert mode, o opens a new line below and enters Insert mode. Esc always " +
			"returns you to Normal mode — you'll press it constantly.",
		Challenges: []Challenge{
			{
				Title: "Type Something",
				Instructions: "i switches from Normal mode into Insert mode, without moving the " +
					"cursor — anything you type from here on is inserted as regular text, just " +
					"like a normal text editor. Press i, type: hello vim — then press Esc to " +
					"drop back into Normal mode.",
				Tip: "Tip: Esc is one of the most-pressed keys in Vim — a lot of people remap " +

			{
				Title: "Append At The End",
				Instructions: "A jumps straight to the end of the line and enters Insert mode there " +
					"— a shortcut for pressing $ and then a. No matter where your cursor " +
					"currently sits on the line, use A to append \" world\" to the end of it.",
				Tip: "Tip: lowercase a inserts right after the cursor's current spot; capital A " +
					"always jumps to end-of-line first, regardless of cursor position.",

				Par:         8,
			},
			{
				Title: "Open A New Line",
				Instructions: "o opens a brand-new, empty line directly below the cursor's current " +
					"line and drops you into Insert mode on it — handy for adding a line without " +
					"first navigating to end-of-line. Use it to insert a line reading: second " +
					"line — between the two lines below.",
				Tip: "Tip: capital O does the same thing but opens the new line ABOVE the " +
					"cursor instead of below — useful when you need to insert something before " +
					"the current line.",

		Week:   "Week 1: Basic Movement",
		Title:  "gg, G, and x",
		Summary: "gg jumps to the very first line, G jumps to the very last line — instant " +
			"travel across a whole file. x deletes the single character under the cursor, " +
			"your first real edit command.",
		Challenges: []Challenge{
			{
				Title: "Jump To The Top",
				Instructions: "gg (tap g twice) jumps straight to line 1 of the file, no matter " +
					"how far down you are — instant travel instead of holding k. Use it to get " +
					"from the bottom of this list back to the top.",
				Tip:         "Tip: gg accepts a count too — 5gg jumps straight to line 5, exactly.",

				Title: "Jump To The Bottom",
				Instructions: "G jumps straight to the very last line of the file — the mirror " +
					"image of gg. Use it to go from the top all the way to the bottom in a " +
					"single keystroke.",
				Tip: "Tip: like gg, G takes a count — 3G jumps to exactly line 3, same as " +
					"typing :3 and pressing enter in command mode.",

			{
				Title: "Delete The Typo",
				Instructions: "x deletes exactly one character — whichever one is currently under " +
					"the cursor — making it your fastest fix for a stray typo. Delete the extra " +
					"l in \"helllo\" below so it reads \"hello\".",
				Tip: "Tip: capital X deletes the character BEFORE the cursor instead of under " +
					"it — reach for X when you've typed one character too many.",

		Title:  "dd, yy, p, P — Delete, Yank, Paste",
		Summary: "dd deletes (and stores) the whole current line. yy yanks (copies) it " +
			"without deleting. p pastes after the current line, P pastes before it. " +
			"Together these are how you move and duplicate lines without ever touching a mouse.",
		Challenges: []Challenge{
			{
				Title: "Delete The Line",
				Instructions: "dd deletes the entire current line in one shot — wherever the " +
					"cursor sits on that line, the whole line goes, and it's saved so you could " +
					"paste it elsewhere. Remove the line that shouldn't be there.",
				Tip: "Tip: 3dd deletes 3 lines starting from the cursor — operators like d " +

			{
				Title: "Duplicate Below",
				Instructions: "yy yanks (copies) the current line without deleting it, and p pastes " +
					"whatever was last yanked or deleted directly below the cursor's line. Yank " +
					"the first line, then paste a copy of it right below itself.",
				Tip: "Tip: think of y as Vim's \"copy\" and d as its \"cut\" — both fill the same " +
					"register, and p is always the paste that follows either one.",

			},
			{
				Title: "Paste Above",
				Instructions: "P (capital) pastes above the cursor's line instead of below it — " +
					"the only difference from lowercase p. Yank \"two\" below, then use P to " +
					"paste a copy of it above itself.",
				Tip: "Tip: lowercase p = paste after/below, capital P = paste before/above. " +
					"This same after-vs-before pattern (a/A, i/I, p/P) repeats all over Vim.",

		Week:   "Week 2: More Operators",
		Title:  "dw, cw, ciw — Operators Meet Word Motions",
		Summary: "Operators (d, c, y) and motions (w) combine freely — you're not limited " +
			"to the dd/yy pairs from Day 5. dw deletes a word forward. cw changes one, but " +
			"has a real Vim quirk: it stops at the end of the current word instead of also " +
			"eating the space after it. ciw sidesteps that entirely by targeting the whole " +
			"word around the cursor, wherever inside it you happen to be.",
		Challenges: []Challenge{
			{
				Title: "Delete The Extra Word",
				Instructions: "You already know d deletes and w moves by word — combine them and " +
					"dw deletes from the cursor to the start of the next word in a single motion. " +
					"Delete the word \"very\" (and the space after it) from the line below.",
				Tip: "Tip: like dd, this combo takes a count too — d3w deletes three words " +
					"forward in one shot.",

				Par:         2,
			},
			{
				Title: "The cw Quirk",
				Instructions: "c changes text just like d deletes it, but cw has a special " +
					"exception: if the cursor sits on a letter (not a space), it only replaces up " +
					"to the end of that word — it leaves the trailing space alone, unlike dw. Fix " +
					"the typo \"quikc\" into \"quick\" using cw.",
				Tip: "Tip: this exception exists so cw feels natural for fixing typos — without " +
					"it, retyping a word would also eat the space after it, forcing you to add it " +
					"back yourself.",
				NewKeys:     []string{"cw"},
				Start:       []string{"quikc dog"},

				Par:         8,
			},
			{
				Title: "Change Inner Word",
				Instructions: "ciw changes the whole word your cursor is inside, no matter which " +
					"letter you're on — unlike cw, you don't need to be sitting on the word's " +
					"first letter. Use ciw to fix \"woord\" into \"word\" even though the cursor " +
					"starts in the middle of it.",
				Tip: "Tip: iw also works with d and y (diw, yiw) — because it grabs just the " +
					"word itself, it's more predictable than w-based motions when the cursor " +
					"isn't sitting on a word's edge.",
