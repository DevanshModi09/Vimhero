			"i enters Insert mode before the cursor, A jumps to end-of-line and enters " +

					"— a shortcut for pressing $ and then a. No matter where your cursor " +
					"currently sits on the line, use A to append \" world of vim editing\" to " +

					"file is missing its opening line; use O to add \"first line\" above what's " +
					"already here.",
				Tip: "Tip: think of the a/A and i/I family — lowercase acts relative to the " +
